Description: A puzzle game where you build 3d shapes using CSG
 Ensemblist is a 3d puzzle game where you have to build 3d shapes
 by combining simplier shapes using Constructive Solid Geometry
 operators Union, Intersection and Soustraction.
 .
 CSG are GPU intensive, so a recent 3d card is needed (like, say,
 any geForce card).
